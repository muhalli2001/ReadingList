Current Side Project!

These are Rest web apis written in Golang for interacting with books and articles on the internet.

*You can search for books and articles.

*Then add these books and articles to 'Reading Lists'

* ex: February: {"book_1": "book title", "book_2":"book title", "article_1", "article title"}

Hoping it will be a great way to keep track of long-form media that you want to read.
Also hoping it helps people read more books and articles in general!

As of right now, the project allows users to search for books via OpenLibrary, a list of books gets sent to the user when they send a search query.
Currently working on returning cover images with the book information to users. 

A few things it uses:

JSON for requests and responses

Golang programming language

HTTP router which I will link soon.

Bash for scripting and testing

Git, Github

Eventually I plan to host this application with:

Caddy reverse proxy

DigitalOcean
